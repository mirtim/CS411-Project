First Idea:

Road Trip App with Recommended places to go/stay
MVP: Enter a starting point and a end point: NYC, NY to NO, LA
  Finds Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner places, as well as a Airbnb/Hotel for the night that are on the way/ not too far off your road trip route.
  Future implementation would have landmarks, entertainment, and maps your expected trip length. 
  
  ** EDIT ** We did not have time to implement the food finding feature, so our application soley finds hotels along the route. 
  
  APIs: 
    Expedia
    Google Maps
    Airbnb https://www.programmableweb.com/api/airbnb
    Apricot API 
    
    ** EDIT ** We decided to use the Yelp API as it offered more flexibility. 




Second Idea:

Activity App based on weather, season, time of the day
  Weather Based Activity App uses the Weather Channel API to determine current weather conditions, and the results are used to recommend activities to the user with the Yelp GraphQL API.
  This API allows us to compare ratings of different places, and we can use this data to order recommendations.
  Oath can be done with Google or Facebook.
