## General info
This is a road trip interactive map. The general purpose for this application is to help with planning a road trip across the United States by finding hotels, restarants and tourist places.<br/>
**How it Works:**<br/>
After succesfully loging into your profile, you can create your first trip by inputing the origin and the destination of the trip. The app will build a route with google maps and suggest hotels, restarants and places to visit along the road. All created trips will be then saved in your profile page and could be accessed any time.

## Technologies and APIs
* MondoDB database
* Express.js - web application framework
* Angular.js - JavaScript MVC framework
* Node.js - backend execution environment
* Google Maps API
* Yelp API
* Google OAuth

We decided to implement RoadTrippie using the MEAN stack. We decided on this as a group because although none of us
had experience with web or javascript development, we were all eager to learn. We also considered Python and Flask or Django
for the backend. We were all pretty familiar with Python, so ultimately we decided on a javascript backend in order to be 
exposed to new technologies and learning opportunity.

## Features
One interesting feature of this app is that it calculated the time of consecutive driving and tracks the time of the day to suggest motels/hotels in the area where you would be by the evening to prevent people from driving during the night time and making sure that they get enough rest.

## Status
Project is: _finished_
