We decided to implement RoadTrippie using the MEAN stack. We decided on this as a group because although none of us
had experience with web or javascript development, we were all eager to learn. We also considered Python and Flask or Django
for the backend. We were all pretty familiar with Python, so ultimately we decided on a javascript backend in order to be 
exposed to new technologies and learning opportunity.
